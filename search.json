    "text": "How is the model going so far?\nYou can find the latest results via the AFL tipping website – just search for “The Footy Forest”\nWhere can I find the predictions for this week?\nFollow me on Facebook for that. In the future I may post each prediction on this site but I have not set that up yet.\nWhich variables (features) does it use?\nIt uses four variables. These are:\n\na measure of each team’s form, based on an Elo formula.\na measure of venue experience\na measure of player rating for each selected team, and\na measure of the distance each team has had to travel. Each of these are calculated for each team and then converted as a relative measure showing the advantage for the home team compared to its opponent on the day.\n\nAre you doing this to make money?\nHell, no. I am doing this for fun and for a challenge. Yes, I am a nerd. And yes, I am obsessed by Australian football.\nShould I use this model to place bets?\nDefinitely not. Betting is for mugs and niff-naffs.\nShould I use this model for footy tipping?\nAbsolutely. Go bananas.\nWhat program did you use to write this model?\nI use R for this project. This is the program I often use for my academic work. While R is extremely powerful and free, but takes some time to learn if you aren’t familiar with line coding.\nDoes this model use ChatGPT, or AI?\nNo. This model is one hundred per cent pure, old fashioned, home-grown human-written computer code, born free right here in the real world.\nIsn’t that a line from The Matrix?\nYes. Yes it is.\nWhat is your background?\nI am a quantitative social scientist who is mainly interested in researching problems in science communication. While this gives me some useful skills in statistical analysis, and I have published some academic work using machine learning techniques, there are many more qualified people than me who have produced similar models. Prior to this I worked in various communication roles.\nWhat techniques are used for this model?\nThis model is an ensemble of models compiled with the R Tidymodels package. It uses a stacked combination of gradient boosted trees, generalised linear models and random forest models to make its predictions.\nWhy is this called the “Footy Forest”?\nA few of the techniques used in this model are tree-based (eg. gradient-boosted trees, random forest), so I thought I’d take the concept and run with it like Ed Langdon on a fast break. Also it predicts … footy.\nWhere do you get your data from?\nI use the FitzRoy package for R. It is wonderful. Cheers to the legends to have developed it and maintain it.\nWhat is Australian football or the Australian Football League?\nMy friend, let me introduce you to by far the best sport on the entire planet.\nWhat football team do you barrack for?\nI barrack for the original Australian football team – the Melbourne Demons.\nWho is your favourite footballer?\nAs a kid my favourite player was Stephen (Stinga) Tingay. But right now it is probably young Caleb Windsor. I guess I have a thing for wingers.\nAre you a real doctor?\nI am not a medical doctor. I have a PhD in science from ANU.\nHow frequently are you actually asked these questions?\nNever. I’ve never been asked any of these questions."
